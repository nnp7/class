<h1>MUSIC</h1>
<p1>  Music is an art form, and a cultural activity, whose medium is sound.
    General definitions of music include common elements such aspitch
    (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo,
    meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities
    of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).
    Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements.
    Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping;
    there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment)
    and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (
    mousike; "art of the Muses").[1] See glossary of musical terminology.

    <h2 id="COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</h2>
<p>
    "Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song, an instrumental music piece,
    a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures,
    including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of music notation,
    such as a sheet music "score", which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians.
    In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting,
    may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody,
    lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, the composer typically orchestrates his or her own
    compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the
    orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in
    her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by
    influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.

    <H3 ID="COMPOSITION">Improvisation</H3>
<p>
    Musical improvisation is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) 
    a pre-existing harmonic framework or chord progression. Improvisers use the notes of the chord, 
    various scales that are associated with each chord, and chromatic ornaments and passing tones
    which may be neither chord tones not from the typical scales associated with a chord. Musical 
    improvisation can be done with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of
    music, such as blues, jazz, and jazz fusion, in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody 
    lines and accompaniment parts.
