<h1> Movie World </h1>
<h2>“ what are Movies? Movies, or films, are a type of visual communication which uses moving pictures and sound to tell stories
    or teach people something. Most people watch movies as a type of entertainment or a way to have fun. For some
    people, fun movies can mean movies that make them laugh, while for others it can mean movies that make them
    cry, or feel afraid.”</h2>

        <b> Genres:Action movies have a lot of exciting effects like car chases and gun fights, involving stuntmen. They usually involve 'goodies' and 'baddies', so war and crime are common subjects. Action movies usually need very little effort to watch, since the plot is normally simple. For example, in Die Hard, terrorists take control of a skyscraper and ask for a big ransom in exchange for not killing the hostage workers. One hero somehow manages to save everyone. Action movies do not usually make people cry, but if the action movie is also a drama, emotion will be involved.
            Adventure Movies usually involve a hero who sets out on a quest to save the world or loved ones.
            Animated movies use artificial images like talking cartoons to tell a story. These movies used to be drawn by hand, one frame at a time, but are now made on computers.
            Buddy movies involve 2 heroes, one must save the other, both must overcome obstacles. Buddy movies often involve comedy, but there is also some emotion, because of the close friendship between the 'buddies'.
            Comedies are funny movies about people being silly or doing unusual things or being in silly or unusual situations that make the audience laugh.
            Documentaries are movies that are (or claim to be) about real people and real events. They are nearly always serious and may involve strongly emotional subjects, for example cruelty.
            Dramas are serious, and often about people falling in love or needing to make a big decision in their life. They tell stories about relationships between people. They usually follow a basic plot where one or two main characters (each actor plays a character) have to 'overcome' (get past) an obstacle (the thing stopping them) to get what they want.
            Tragedies are always dramas, and are about people in trouble. For example, a husband and wife who are divorcing must each try to prove to a court of law that they are the best person to take care of their child. Emotion (feelings) are a big part of the movie and the audience (people watching the movie) may get upset and even cry.
            Film noir movies are 1940s-era detective dramas about crime and violence.
            Family movies are made to be good for the entire family. They are mainly made for children but often entertaining for adults as well. Disney is famous for their family movies.
            Horror movies use fear to excite the audience. Music, lighting and sets (man-made places in movie studios where the movie is made) are all designed to add to the feeling.
            Romantic Comedies (Rom-Coms) are usually love stories about 2 people from different worlds, who must overcome obstacles to be together. Rom-Coms are usually light-hearten, but may include some emotion.
            Comedy horror movies blend horror and comic motifs in its plots. Movies in this genre sometimes use black comedy as the main form of humor.
            Science fiction movies are set in the future or in outer space. Some use their future or alien settings to ask questions about the meaning of life or how we should think about life. Science fiction movies often use special effects to create images of alien worlds, outer space, alien creatures, and spaceships.
            Fantasy movies include magical and impossible things that any real human being cannot do.
            Thrillers are usually about a mystery, strange event, or crime that needs to be solved. The audience is kept guessing until the final minutes, when there are usually 'twists' in the plot (surprises).
            Suspense movies keep you on the edge of your seat. They usually have multiple twists that confuse the watcher.
            Western movies tell stories about cowboys in the western United States in the 1870s and 1880s. They are usually action movies, but with historical costumes. Some involve Native Americans. Not all films that are set in the American West are made there. For example, Western films made in Italy are called Spaghetti Westerns. Some films can also use Western plots even if they are set in other places.

        <b>In the tradition of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, some psychologists today still use dreams in therapy to help people better understand themselves and their psyches. Rubin Naiman, PhD, is one such psychologist. A sleep and dream expert with the University of Arizona’s Center for Integrative Medicine, Naiman not only advocates for the power of dreams but also believes society is in the midst of an “epidemic of dream loss,” spurred on by the collective brush-off our culture has given to these nightly visions.
            “We are so dismissive about dreams,” he says. “It’s a huge issue. It’s kind of like pretending the moon doesn’t exist.”</b>
    </p>

        <b>In the 1970s, Oldis was involved in early dream research that focused on whether dreams had an effect on our waking lives. It was at this time when researchers discovered that people bodies move while they dream. While this was important information, it became newly relevant to Oldis in 2014, when he read about researchers in Japan who were capturing images from dreams using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). That got him thinking: Why not also record their movements? And while you’re at it, why not speech as well?
            “If you put that all together, what you have is a movie,” Oldis says.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>That became his new research question: Can dreams be turned into watchable movies? This led Oldis to partner with the University of Texas at Austin’s Cognitive Neuroscience Lab in 2017 to track the motor behavior of a dreamer. By using an electromyogram (EGM) to measure nerve impulses to the muscles, the researchers successfully recorded the movements of a subject’s dreams, which Oldis turned into a walking avatar that he presented at the International Association for the Study of Dreams in 2017 — the first step to making a dream movie.
            “This is like the early years of the space race,” he says. “But in this case, we’re going into the dream space.”</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Oldis has also done some early work around recording dream speech. By attaching electrodes to a sleeper’s speech muscles, he was able to pick up some elements of their dream dialogues, though full sentences and meanings could not be deciphered. He plans to run another experiment at the University of Texas at Austin this fall that he hopes will result in complete speech readings.
            In addition to conducting those experiments, Oldis has compiled a team of nearly two dozen dream researchers, neurobiologists, sleep scientists, and psychologists (which he calls “the dream team”) from academic institutions and organizations across the country — including the UCLA School of Medicine, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, and more — to put all the components together and create the first dream movie. Next summer, the team will take over a recording studio in Burbank, California. They’ll bring in a mobile MRI and attempt to record the movement, speech, and images from the full dreams of three or four sleeping subjects.</b>
